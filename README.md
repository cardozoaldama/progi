A little Java project for testing the Object Oriented Programming.

## Java Object-Oriented Programming Project

This project aims to demonstrate various features of object-oriented programming using the Java programming language. It includes the usage of an IDE, a PostgreSQL database management system, and Java JSP.

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
- PostgreSQL database management system
- Apache Tomcat server

## Setup

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cardozoaldama/progi.git

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Configure the database connection in the project:
    - ~Update the database connection details in the config.properties file.~

4. Import the database schema:
    - Create a new database in your PostgreSQL server.
    - ~Import the database schema from the database.sql file located in the project.~

5. Build and run the project:
    - Start the Apache Tomcat server.
    - Deploy the project on the server.
    - Access the project in your web browser using the provided URL.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can explore and test various object-oriented programming features implemented in Java. The project includes examples and demonstrations of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. You can navigate through the project's codebase and examine how these concepts are applied.

*Feel free to modify and enhance the project according to your needs. Contributions are welcome if you want!*
